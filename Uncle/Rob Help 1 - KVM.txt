Hey Chris!

My apologies for not contacting you earlier, I've had a lot of stuff going on lately. I've CC'd this to my personal email address,
which will be the one I use from now on for this conversation.
I'm glad that you're getting to do some hands-on stuff. That's the best way to learn this field.

What I was talking about is creating a virtual machine that contains its own hypervisor (KVM, in this case)
and then creating some virtual lab infrastructure for you. However, it has occurred to me that you'd get a
lot more out of the experience if we built it together.
We can do this either remotely, using Skype / WebEx / something, or one of us can make a trip to the other's house. If you brought your Dad up to
Bainbridge Island for a weekend it'd be pretty awesome. We could combination LAN / build a lab.

Let me know what works best for you. If you want to get started on your own, here's the rough task list.
create a 4 GB of RAM VM with vmware player or your hypervisor of choice. Make sure that you enable
virtualization extensions, if applicable, in the VM configuration.
install debian 7 amd64 (sometimes known as x86_64) build into the VM. do not install the full desktop environment during the setup process.
create your main user account
once the linux installation is completed, install xfce4. It's a much lighter (in the memory sense) desktop environment
install KVM

***

create four virtual networks
"VM management", NAT to outside world
"outside", isolated
"inside", isolated
"backplane", isolated
Once you get to that point then I will help you build the specific utility VMs and network topology. Things that you can expect to be installing
metasploit
web server (apache, nginx, whatever)
DVWA (damn vulnerable web app)
HackMe Casino (I think this is what it's called)
wireshark
FreeBSD + dummynet — this lets you do some interesting latency stuff
I'll try to respond to questions in the evenings. Definitely think about a visit. :)
